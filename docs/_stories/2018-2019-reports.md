      This is the first series of reports cards on NSW trout fishery monitoring streams. These streams were selected with stakeholders at the **Trout Strategy Workshops in 2018**.

      These streams are designed to be indicators on how the fishery is tracking across the 3 regions and across the state.

      Each report card  provides specific information on what fish are in each site.
