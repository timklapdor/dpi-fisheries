      The spawning run of brown and rainbow trout in the rivers flowing to Eucumbene and Jindabyne Dams form an integral component of the fishery in the region.

        In order to track numbers of trout in the annual spawn run, we are installing a VAKI Riverwatcher system. This will be complemented by a number of Trout Scout video systems.

        The trap on the Thredbo River will also be supplemented with Trout Scout video systems situated in the Jindabyne catchment.

      The [VAKI Riverwatcher](){: .text-dpi-yellow} is used in widely in Europe, America and Canada to monitor migratory salmonids.

      The Trout Scout is based on the [“Smolt Spy”](){: .text-dpi-yellow} designed by [FISHBIO](){: .text-dpi-yellow} in America. FISHBIO use it mainly to monitor juvenile fish but NSW DPI have designed systems for a range of environments and fish sizes.

      The VAKI Riverwatcher is a fish counting tool used to collect data on fish numbers and movements and this information will aid in the improved management of the Snowy Lakes fisheries.

      The system includes an infrared scanner which records a silhouette image of the fish and this scanner also triggers a camera which captures photographs or video of each fish.

      The Trout Scout video systems are based off the American FISHBIO’s “Smolt Spy”. It involves a motion detection Camera system that will record any fish moving through the device. From this we are able to collect information about when trout travel up and downstream to spawn, as well as size range and species.

      The fish trap on the Thredbo River at Gaden has been in place for many years. The trap is checked daily by hatchery staff and all fish measured and checked for tags. Those that are not required for the hatchery operations are released upstream so they can continue on their journey.

      Why use the VAKi and video systems to monitor numbers in the trout spawning run?
    text_list_items:
    - "**Non-invasive** - We can count, identify, and observe trout without having to touch them or remove them from the water."
    - "**Remote Access** - We can access some of the information remotely in all weather conditions."
    - "Complements previous and current electrofishing monitoring."
    - "Suitable to use in remote areas."
